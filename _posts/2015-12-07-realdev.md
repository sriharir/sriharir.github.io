title:  "Real developer"
---

This blog post marks my introduction to real development as I prepare to start with node.js. It's always been on the back of my mind - wanting to learn the "only real developer language". This post tries to capture my initial impressions and ideas about the language in noobish terms.

First of all, with my limited ideas of the language I think it's going to be more involved when it comes to writing code, and that too much low level code as say compared to Django or Rails. So, node.js is a language that uses JavaScript syntax to write backend code. Numerous high level frameworks have been built on top of node.js. But I would right now start learning to write code from ground zero in node.js devoid of any framework abstractions.

The idea is to complete building something from this video tutorial I have, and then move on to building other interesting and involved projects from other tutorials I could possibly lay my hands on. This seems like a good time now, after an overload of competitive programming code for ICPC preparation. I would love to have that feel of having to think less and code more, figuring out design paradigms, eradicating bugs, and as usual running into installation and version issues in Linux (although I would love it even more if I am able to figure them out after a shorter survey on the internet than usual).

So here I go!
