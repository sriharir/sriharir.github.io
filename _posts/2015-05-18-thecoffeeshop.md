We don't appreciate our places enough. The same roads I travel through almost every other day, the same pavements, the same inroads. All of them seemed like a completely different place, while on foot.

Today evening was mildly chilly, and I was with company. There were three of us, all of us with no plans for the future, both immediate and long term, and a common consensus to hit the road on foot. All of us, lived pretty close to each other and the area was equally well known. After being shut out to a remote campus in the middle of nowhere for four months, what I looked forward to in Kochi turned out to be the traffic, the crowd, the sprawling malls and the city lights. So the nearest highway, that's where we were headed to.

The highway was inviting. Just enough traffic to set the mood, but not too much to disturb our stroll by the side. The wind blew against our faces now, and we embraced the chill. The atmosphere was serene, even with rushing cars, and roaring trucks. I found peace because I could walk as slow as I wished, and not be worried about being late anywhere. I could choose to take the diversion, I could go around the longer path. I could go back any time I wished to, and not be worried about waking up late the next day. It felt like, after a long time, I had so many choices. There were people rushing, but we were in no hurry. All of us had stories to tell, and we took our turns while waiting for the traffic to thin down so we could cut across the road. The fact that I did not complete as much work as I should've did not bother me much then. I was not overwhelmed by all the race back at college everyone is getting part of, then. 

Instead, I was watching the traffic, about people cruising really fast towards home, or to a destination, or to meet an emergency. I thought of all the times at college when a test or a submission the next day meant any kind of outing could not last longer than the bare minimum amount of time, for there is work and responsibility to attend to. I wondered why my choices led me to a point where those kinds of days happen more often than the present day. Humanity has evolved with a lot of systems in place which literally drains happiness and calm out of people. I understand it's a necessity for advancement of civilization, but the realization is shadowed by the question as to whether college, and education in general has evolved to mass produce human resources to cater to corporations, rather than to a collective effort to forward humanity.

But I don't care. Because, I don't deem myself fit to race to the finish, for I need to stop, and I need to breathe slow, and I need to think alone. And today was turning out to be an actualization of the dream to chill much. So, we crossed the road and took abode in a good coffee place. There were barely ten people in there, and we talked about Japanese shows, British movies, and sandwiches. When we finished and paid our bills, leaving only 10 rupees as tip for an extremely courteous coffee shop guy (he did not seem like a full time waiter, and hence I would refrain from using that word), we decided to walk further. 

Soon we reached this inroad I always see, but never bothered to explore, and decided it's where we wanted to go. The experience was kind of revelatory, because while passing by in a car, these roads, and houses, and tree, beyond the pavement seemed like a 2-d wall of pictures, which exist as a prop to the road, to complement the view, and it kind of never occurred to me there could be space in there, living people, and activity. But there they were, lots of houses, and people watching televisi
