title:  "People Skills"

As far as my memory goes, people always had been tough for me. Unless I bond really well with someone, I can't sustain a conversation or fill up any scope for small talk with something other than awkward question reply sessions. But more than that, I never bothered to make conversations such that the other person, on the other end feels good about himself, which is often cited as the one very basic foundation of a good conversation.

Rather, I was obsessed with telling people about things that I'm curious or surprised about, and hearing from them their views. As long as the conversation doesn't fall under this category, I find it to be utterly out of control. So, indeed, its impossible for me to grow in a community without the former skills I mentioned that I'm lacking.

Often, I fail to impress people through words. I miss out on a lot of good people due to this held back nature of mine. More annoyingly, I face the trauma of having to deal with idiots, whom I have zero ability to converse with or tolerate - maybe people who are oblivious of his stupidity. They tend to not recognize my type or intellect and drag down conversations to their level and eventually annoy the hell out of my sane self.

But as I said, I am not completely hopeless. Luckily for me, I've found quite a few people of my kind. They share similar interests, ambitions, and mindset for growth. They observe and are intrigued by same things as I. When things are bleak, a conversation over chai could prove the ultimate catharsis.

I have never believed in trained instincts. I always believed instincts should always mature over experience and not be forcefully replaced by socially more rewarding ones. But experience tells me the way to mature is to practice. Observe and be conscious about you response for a while, and one day you'll look back and remember how it used to be before. Self improvement does take a bit of conscious effort and trained reactions. Try to compile a list of things to be done or be said for maximization of people attracting capacity. And try to reduce encounters with not-so-bright people, and focus on growth.
