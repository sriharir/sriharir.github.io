title: Days Gone By
---

 It was only me and mom at home for the day and we were to spend the day outside. Mom had few errands to run, and the day kick started pretty early by my standards - by around 12 in the noon. So I picked up a book and settled down inside the car imagining I would just camp in there until we're back. Mom knows the extend of my laziness and I knew she would not push me too much to join her as she paid bills and did grocery shopping. And she didn't either. At around 3 we were heading back home when we stopped at the fuel station to refill gas.

As we approached the fuel station, I could see that apart from the usual guys in blue and orange uniform from HP (Hindustan Petroleum), there was another guy in mid twenties, filling gas. He wore a checkered purple shirt with rolled up sleeves and denim trousers that tapered down until it was at par with the width of his leg just above the feet. The trouser merged perfectly with his light blue canvas shoes. As we came closer, I observed he wore this certain heavily loaded wrist watch, that in spite of its best efforts to look costly, could easily be made out to be of not more than a hundred bucks. Seeing things like this would always depress me, things like wearing a cheap wrist watch that is made to look expensive. Like, it would be much better off if these people wouldn't wear any watch - at least it wouldn't depress the shit out of people like me. Well, anyways, this is what a typical Kochi youth from a not-so-well-off families desperate to be seen 'modern' would look like. They could be seen roaming the malls in similar attire along with 'Rey-ban' shades, and often few of them speaking broken English. All these guys depress the hell out of me. At the same time, awesome young guys who are proud of their Malayalitham could also be seen, wearing orange (kaavi ) lungi and speaking awesome Malayalam in their natural tongue.

So anyway, the young guy at the fuel station belonged to the former group. When it was our turn to get our car filled, I figured he was a trainee at the station, getting instructions and suggestions at every step of the process of filling fuel, from the old guy in uniform standing besides. He would soon take it up as his job and would wear the saggy uniform in place of his current fashion statement, possibly replacing the old man next to him. He was watched by the old guy, as he typed in the digits 5, 0 and another 0. He did it without much effort or concentration, but stole a glance at the old guy, possibly searching for signs of approval or appreciation. He proceeded to fill our cars tank and I turned back to look at the meter on the filling machine to make sure the numbers are right.

As the numbers ticked by in the meter, much faster than from about two years ago due to frequent hikes in fuel prices, I stole a glance at the young guy's face. I saw a sad face. He looked tired and disappointed. I could clearly see his in his eyes, the feeling of having submitted to destiny - and definitely not the one he dream of. As he stood there waiting for the filling to finish, trying to look casual and not so steadfast about the job at hand, his thoughts were probably wandering somewhere else. He was looking far away into nothing in particular. He glanced at the meter that had just crossed 300 mark, and resumed his pointless staring, lost in thoughts. 

Seeing his face, all I could think of was him thinking of how he had failed to be all that he aspired to be. He was not the movie star the fairness cream ad promised to make him, neither the renowned athlete that the sports shoe company told him he could be, neither the millionaire businessman like the ones in suits he saw on television. Neither could he ever aspire of getting married to the extremely hot girl he saw at McDonald's munching french fries and sipping Coke, as opposed to just-the-burger he decided to have. Instead, he was going to be doing this very monotonous job, the least entertainment he could ever expect from which is if he gets to fill some luxury-branded cars. The cars he dreamed of owning when he was younger; a dream that seemed silly in the face of harsh reality he was facing right then. 

As the digits slowed down and approached 500, he brought his attention back to the filling and heaved a sigh as if in acceptance, his eyes still partially lost in thoughts of lost dreams. I felt extremely depressed as I handed over a 500 rupee currency to the guy, that he proceeded to put in a drawer nearby. The old guy stopped him, and snatched the currency from him and proceeded to hold it against the sun, to make sure its not a counterfeit. When the old guy was convinced the currency was not a fake, he handed it back, not without an advice in scholarly voice to never let a currency pass without the sun-test. I felt miserable thinking that not a part of the money belongs to the trainee guy, as of now. Yet there he was, filling our car's tank. 

As we moved away from the fuel station, I turned back to look at the guy. There weren't more vehicles coming up, and he was unoccupied for the moment. He assumed an awkward body language, which seemed natural considering there was nothing exciting to go back to or nothing interesting to occupy himself with at the moment. I sincerely wished the best for him. He could start doing some business and that could flourish like anything and be all he wished to be. But the acceptance he showed to his fate right then, made me doubt as to his ability to go forward and push his boundaries. He could win a lottery - that seems possible. Yes, he is the kind of dreamy Kochi youth who would often spend money on lottery tickets. I wished he would win a lottery worth a lot of money. He could then buy the fuel station and run it as a manager and could get his car filled from the station often. He would only employ really old people to do the monotonous task of filling gas - old people who don't have a lot of dreams to give up on. 

I returned to my book. I never thought of that guy again until I sat down to write this. I resumed to read about McMurphy and Co. as they plotted against the Big Nurse and eventually forgot all about the face I saw from my car window. Now, I don't even remember the face properly now. But I can still feel the sense of helplessness, disappointment and disinterest I witnessed in the guy's eyes. And it depresses me like hell, even now.
