I think, that’s it. End of the relationship.

Its been an extremely strained relationship for the past 4 to 5 years. When it started out, you were of course boring, but not troubling. But as time went by, the biggest stakes for me then, were heavily dependent on my relationship with you. Soon, I realized its not working out, and I had never actually bonded with you. Unfortunately, it had to go on. You proved a hindrance to me getting things I wanted rather too often. Your demands grew exponentially, and I had more and more trouble comprehending you.

And that’s why I am extremely relieved its coming to an end. Lucky for both of us (at least for me) it ended on a high, disregarding minor glitches. I think its time to say goodbye.

Of course, there is sadness. Sadness at the void created. Regardless of everything, you were there with me during some defining moments of my life. But that’s fine.

In the end, I don’t think I’ll miss you. 
Because, then again, Chemistry, you were a b*tch.
